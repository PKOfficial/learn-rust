fn main() {

    // Functions
    // Functions are declared using the fn keyword.
    // Rust style guide recommends snake case for function names. Lowercase with underscores between words.
    // Function don't need to be declared in any specific order.
    // Function parameter are declared with a name and type. (name: type)
    // Multiple parameters are separated by commas.
    // We can specify the return type of a function using -> followed by the type.
    // The return value of the function is the value of the final expression in the block of the body of the function.
    // Shorthand of return: If we don't put a semicolon at the end of the expression, it will be returned.
    // Tail expression: The last expression in a block of code.
